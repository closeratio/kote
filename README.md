# Kote

Kote is a web-based realtime voting application written in Kotlin. Its current aim is to introduce interactivity into events like lectures, presentations, and other similar scenarios. Kote runs as a standalone web application and can be configured to use a number of different datasources.

## Roadmap

* Pre-prepared questions
* Realtime voting feedback (using websockets)
* Voting statistics
* User-entered answers
* Timer-based voting
